# Platform Patterns - Generic ONDEMANDENV Patterns

This directory contains **GENERIC** platform patterns and development guidelines that can be applied to ANY system built on the ONDEMANDENV platform.

## üìã **GENERIC PLATFORM DOCUMENTATION**

### **Core Platform Patterns (Ordered by Importance):**

1. **`ENVER_BASED_SERVICE_CONTEXT_PATTERN.md`**: **üöÄ ULTIMATE BEST PRACTICE** - Revolutionary PHASES = ENVERS architecture
2. **`ONDEMANDENV_PLATFORM.md`**: Generic platform interface and architecture patterns with PHASES = ENVERS insight
3. **`SERVICE_PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_PATTERN.md`**: Generic service development lifecycle and phase management
4. **`WEB_CLIENT_BDD_PATTERN.md`**: Generic web client BDD testing patterns with enver alignment
5. **`ONDEMANDENV_PLATFORM_schema.md`**: Generic platform schema and configuration patterns

### **üö® CRITICAL: GENERIC PATTERNS ONLY**

These documents contain:
- ‚úÖ **GENERIC** platform concepts, patterns, and templates
- ‚úÖ **PLACEHOLDER** examples using generic service names (Service A, Service B, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **TEMPLATE** structures that can be applied to any system
- ‚úÖ **UNIVERSAL** development patterns and best practices

These documents do NOT contain:
- ‚ùå **IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFIC** details for any particular system
- ‚ùå **CONCRETE** examples with real service names or data
- ‚ùå **SYSTEM-SPECIFIC** mock data or configuration
- ‚ùå **DOMAIN-SPECIFIC** business logic or requirements

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION-SPECIFIC CONTENT**

For concrete implementation details, see:
- **`../_impl/`**: Contains system-specific implementation details, mock data, and concrete examples

## üìñ **USAGE GUIDELINES**

### **For Platform Teams:**
- Use these patterns as templates for new systems
- Maintain generic nature - avoid system-specific details
- Update patterns based on platform evolution
- Ensure patterns work across different domains

### **For Implementation Teams:**
- Reference these patterns for development guidance
- Create implementation-specific documentation in `_impl/`
- Extract concrete examples to implementation folders
- Follow generic patterns while adapting to specific needs

### **For System Architects:**
- Use as foundation for system design
- Adapt generic patterns to specific requirements
- Maintain separation between platform patterns and implementation details
- Ensure consistency across multiple systems using these patterns

This separation ensures that platform patterns remain reusable across different systems while implementation details are properly organized and maintained separately.
