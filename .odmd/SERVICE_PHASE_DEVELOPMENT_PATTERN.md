# Service Phase Development Pattern - Implementation Guide

**CRITICAL PLATFORM PATTERN**: Standardized phased development approach for all services on the ondemandenv.dev platform.

## üìã Overview

This document provides the complete implementation pattern for service phase development that ensures:
- **Systematic Progress**: Clear milestones and checkpoints
- **Quality Assurance**: Validation at each phase
- **Cross-Service Consistency**: Standardized development approach
- **Platform Integration**: Proper contract and schema integration
- **BDD Alignment**: Perfect test data consistency across all services

## üöÄ Standard Phase Structure

> IMPORTANT ‚Äî Phase Status Gating
> - Phase 0A is automatically ‚úÖ DONE upon service context generation.
> - All other phases require explicit user confirmation before marking ‚úÖ COMPLETE.
> - Canonical progression: mock ‚Üí dev ‚Üí main (no forward references).

### Phase Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**: Phase fully implemented and validated **[USER CONFIRMED]**
- üü° **PLANNED**: Phase designed but not yet implemented
- üîµ **ROADMAP**: Future phase on development roadmap
- üü† **IN_PROGRESS**: Phase currently being worked on
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **NEEDS_VALIDATION**: Phase implementation complete but requires user confirmation

### üö® **CRITICAL PLATFORM RULE: PHASE STATUS CONFIRMATION**

**NO PHASE STATUS SHALL BE MARKED AS ‚úÖ COMPLETE WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER CONFIRMATION**

**EXCEPTION: Phase 0A is automatically ‚úÖ DONE when service context is generated**

When generating or updating service contexts:
1. **PHASE 0A ONLY**: Automatically mark as ‚úÖ DONE since context generation = Phase 0A completion
2. **ALL OTHER PHASES**: NEVER automatically mark as ‚úÖ COMPLETE 
3. **ALWAYS** ask user to confirm Phase 0B+ status before marking complete
4. **DEFAULT** all services to Phase 0A ‚úÖ DONE, Phase 0B üü† IN_PROGRESS
5. **REQUIRE** user validation for Phase 0B+ progression
6. **DOCUMENT** user confirmation date and details when marking phases complete

## üìã Phase 0: Contract Verification with Mock Data/Code using BDD Tests

**CRITICAL**: Phase 0 is specifically for verifying contracts, schema validation, and mocked data responses using dual BDD tests. NO business logic implementation.

**OBJECTIVE**: Establish and verify service contracts through comprehensive BDD testing with mocked responses.

### Phase 0A: Contract Surface Layer
**Objective**: Establish service contracts with mocked infrastructure

#### Required Deliverables:
```markdown
- [x] **CDK Stack Setup**: Basic service stack with an HTTP API and Lambda handlers.
- [x] **Domain and TLS**: A registered domain name, a valid TLS certificate (e.g., from AWS Certificate Manager), and a TLS-enabled (HTTPS) custom endpoint for the API.
- [x] **Contract Integration**: `OdmdShareOut` publishing the service's custom base URL, and consuming any upstream services.
- [x] **Basic Endpoints**: Core API endpoints returning MOCKED, schema-compliant responses only.
- [x] **Storage Layer**: S3/DynamoDB with proper encryption (SSE-KMS) - for schemas and mock data only.
- [x] **Event Integration**: SQS queues for mocked event publishing.
- [x] **Master Mock Dataset (Conception)**: Authoritative dataset authored at ContractsLib implementation level (IDs/tokens/keys and per-UC flows) to be projected to services in 0B.
```

**CRITICAL**: All endpoints must return **MOCKED DATA ONLY** - no business logic implementation.

#### Checkpoint Validation Template:
```bash
cd services/<service-name>
npm run Odmd<ServiceName>:cdk:ls --silent
# Expected output: Odmd<ServiceName>

# Verify contract integration
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Odmd<ServiceName> \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey==`<serviceApiBaseUrl>`].OutputValue' --output text
# Should return valid API endpoint URL

# Verify mocked endpoint responses
curl -X POST https://<service>-api.<domain>/<endpoint> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{<test-payload>}'
# Should return MOCKED response with proper schema structure
```

### Phase 0B: BDD Contract Verification
**Objective**: Verify contracts through dual-level BDD testing with mocked data

#### Required Deliverables:
```markdown
- [x] **Zod Schemas**: Complete request/response schemas in `lib/handlers/src/schemas/zod.ts`
- [x] **Schema Deployment**: `deploySchema(this, schemaString, enver.<baseUrl>.children[0])`
- [x] **Schema Consumption**: Downloads upstream schemas via `json-schema-to-zod`
- [x] **Mocked Handlers**: Lambda handlers returning schema-valid MOCKED responses
- [x] **Schema Validation**: All requests validated against Zod schemas
- [x] **BDD Test Integration**: Perfect alignment with web-client dual BDD (Step Functions + Playwright)
- [x] **Build Integration**: `bin/gen-schemas.ts` with AWS_REGION checks
- [x] **Contract Artifact (pick one or bundle)**:
  - **OpenAPI 3.1** for HTTP endpoints (multi-path), or
  - **AsyncAPI 2.x** for messaging channels/messages, or
  - **ODMD Bundle** referencing both.
  Keep OAS `servers[0].url` empty; consumers use the platform-resolved base URL.
- [x] **Service Mock Projection**: Decompose the master mock dataset into service-specific mock cases in `src/lib/repos/[service]/docs/MOCK_ENVER_CONTEXT.md`, covering every relevant UC step with concrete request/response/message examples that validate against artifacts.
```

**CRITICAL**: Two-level BDD verification:
1. **Step Functions BDD**: API-level contract testing with HTTP invoke
2. **Playwright BDD**: GUI-level contract testing through web interface

#### Checkpoint Validation Template:
```bash
cd services/<service-name>
npm run Odmd<ServiceName>:generate:schemas
# Should generate valid JSON schema without errors

# Verify schema deployment
aws s3 ls s3://odmd-<service>-schemas/<rev>/
# Should show: <serviceApiBaseUrl>-schema-url.json (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/Bundle)

# Verify BDD integration - Step Functions level
aws stepfunctions start-execution --state-machine-arn <BDD_ARN> --input '{...}'
# Should test service contracts via HTTP invoke

# Verify BDD integration - Playwright level  
cd services/web-client/vite && npm run test:bdd
# Should test service contracts via web GUI

# Verify schema validation with invalid request
curl -X POST https://<service>-api.<domain>/<endpoint> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{invalid-schema-payload}'
# Should return 400 with Zod validation error

# Verify schema validation with valid request
curl -X POST https://<service>-api-mock.amazonaws.com/<endpoint> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{valid-schema-payload}'
# Should return 200 with mocked response matching response schema
```

## üìã Phase 1: MVP (Essential)

curl -X POST https://<service>-api.<domain>/<endpoint> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <real-token>" \
  -d '{<real-payload>}'
# Should return REAL response with actual business logic processing

# Verify event publishing with real data
aws sqs receive-message --queue-url <service-event-queue-url>
# Should show real events after actual operations
```

## üìã Phase 3: Production Ready

### Phase 3A: BDD Integration & Testing

    "test_data": "<bdd-aligned-test-payload>"
  }'
# Should return BDD-expected response format with consistent UUIDs

# Verify error handling
curl -X POST https://<service>-api-mock.amazonaws.com/<endpoint> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{invalid-payload}'

## üîß Implementation Templates

### ENVER-Based Service Context Architecture - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**üöÄ REVOLUTIONARY INSIGHT: PHASES = ENVERS**

Every service repository **must** include **FIVE CONTEXT FILES** that decompose service development by enver:

```
src/lib/repos/[service]/docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SERVICE_CONTEXT.md          # Navigation hub with enver mapping
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SERVICE_OVERVIEW.md         # High-level architecture (enver-agnostic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MOCK_ENVER_CONTEXT.md      # Phase 0: Contract verification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DEV_ENVER_CONTEXT.md       # Phase 1: MVP development
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MAIN_ENVER_CONTEXT.md      # Phase 2+: Production deployment
```

**üö® ULTRA CRITICAL: ENVER CONTEXT COMPLETENESS REQUIREMENTS**

Each enver context **MUST BE COMPLETELY SELF-CONTAINED** for independent development:

1. **ALL EXTRACTED INFORMATION**: Must contain ALL relevant information extracted/projected from:
   - System design documents
   - Architecture specifications  
   - Cross-service integration requirements
   - Use case flows involving this service
   - Contract specifications and dependencies
   - Security and privacy requirements
   - DNS and infrastructure patterns

2. **INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY**: A developer should be able to:
   - Understand the service's complete role in the system
   - Implement all required functionality
   - Integrate with all dependent services
   - Deploy and validate the service
   - **WITHOUT NEEDING TO REFERENCE ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS**

3. **CONSISTENT SYNCHRONIZATION**: Service contexts must be:
   - Updated whenever system design changes
   - Synchronized across all related services
   - Validated for consistency with platform patterns
   - Regenerated when dependencies change

This file acts as a self-contained, comprehensive guide for any developer or agent working on the service. It is generated by decomposing the high-level system design documents into a service-specific context with ALL necessary information included.

```markdown

### Contract Integration Pattern
```typescript
// services/<service-name>/lib/<service-name>-stack.ts
export interface <ServiceName>Enver extends OdmdEnverCdk {
  // Upstream consumers (services this service depends on)
  upstreamServiceApiBaseUrl?: OdmdCrossRefConsumer<<ServiceName>Enver, OdmdEnverCdk>;
  
  // Producers (what this service provides)
  readonly serviceApiBaseUrl: OdmdCrossRefProducer<OdmdEnverCdk>;
  
  // Environment metadata
  envId?: string;
}

export interface <ServiceName>StackProps extends StackProps {
  enver: <ServiceName>Enver;
}

export class <ServiceName>Stack extends Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props: <ServiceName>StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Phase 1A: Basic infrastructure
    const api = new HttpApi(this, '<ServiceName>Api');
    const handler = new Function(this, '<ServiceName>Handler', {
      // Lambda configuration
    });

    // Phase 1B: Schema deployment
    const schemaString = readFileSync('lib/handlers/src/schemas/schema.json', 'utf8');
    const deployedSchema = await deploySchema(
      this, 
      schemaString, 
      props.enver.serviceApiBaseUrl.children[0]
    );

    // Contract publishing
    new OdmdShareOut(this, '<ServiceName>ApiBaseUrl', {
      enver: props.enver,
      producer: props.enver.serviceApiBaseUrl,
      value: api.apiEndpoint
    });
  }
}
```

### BDD Integration Pattern
```typescript
// services/<service-name>/lib/handlers/src/index.ts
import { TEST_CONSTANTS } from './test-constants';

export const SERVICE_TEST_DATA = {
  // Use consistent UUIDs across all services (from centralized constants)
  ENTITY_ID: TEST_CONSTANTS.ROOT_IDENTITY_ID, // "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"
  USER_ID: TEST_CONSTANTS.USER_ID,
  
  // Use consistent tokens and signatures
  AUTH_TOKEN: TEST_CONSTANTS.TEMP_TOKEN, // "mock_temp_token_12345"
  AUTH_JWT: TEST_CONSTANTS.AUTH_JWT_TOKEN, // "mock_auth_jwt_token_for_testing"
  
  // Service-specific test data (must align with other services)
  SERVICE_SPECIFIC_DATA: {
    // Service-specific constants that align with centralized test data
  }
};

export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayProxyEventV2): Promise<APIGatewayProxyResultV2> => {
  // Phase 3A: BDD-aligned mock responses
  if (event.body) {
    const req = JSON.parse(event.body);
    
    // Use centralized test constants for consistent responses
    if (req.entity_id === SERVICE_TEST_DATA.ENTITY_ID) {
      return {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify({
          // BDD-aligned response using centralized constants
          entity_id: SERVICE_TEST_DATA.ENTITY_ID,
          result: "success",
          // Service-specific response data
        })
      };
    }
  }
  
  // Standard error response
  return {
    statusCode: 400,
    body: JSON.stringify({ error: "Invalid request" })
  };
};
```

   - **Validate contract integration** patterns match across all services  
   - **Ensure DNS and infrastructure** patterns are consistent
   - **Verify test data alignment** across all services

### For Existing Services - SERVICE CONTEXT COMPLETENESS AUDIT:

**üö® CRITICAL: AUDIT AND ENSURE COMPLETE SELF-CONTAINMENT**

1. **COMPLETENESS AUDIT**: Verify service context contains ALL necessary information:
   - **System Design Information**: All service-specific requirements extracted
   - **Detailed Design Specifications**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **ASK USER IF MISSING**: Complete service design details
   - **Use Case Coverage**: All relevant use case flows documented completely

## üöÄ **MASTER MOCK DATA SET ARCHITECTURE**

### **CRITICAL INTEGRATION: Complete Mock Data Ecosystem Generation**

The platform MUST generate a comprehensive, consistent mock data ecosystem from user design input:

#### **1. MASTER DATA SET GENERATION PROCESS:**

```markdown
USER DESIGN INPUT ‚Üí MASTER MOCK DATA SET ‚Üí SERVICE-SPECIFIC EXTRACTION ‚Üí PHASE 0B INTEGRATION

**A. Master Data Generation:**
- **Cross-Service Entity Graph**: Generate consistent UUIDs, tokens, keys across all services
- **Use Case Flow Data**: Create complete data scenarios for all 6 use cases
- **Realistic Data Patterns**: Generate data that represents actual system usage
- **Error Condition Data**: Include edge cases and error scenarios for comprehensive testing

**B. Service-Specific Data Extraction:**
- **Service A**: Extract domain-specific entities, authentication data, session tokens
- **Service B**: Extract cryptographic materials, signatures, key data, nonces
- **Service C**: Extract privacy-preserving entities, encrypted data, metadata
- **Service D**: Extract relationship data, references, operations
- **Service E**: Extract public distribution data, key sets, domain-specific keys
- **Service F**: Extract credential data, certificates, validation chains
- **Web Client**: Extract UI scenarios, test flows, user interactions

**C. Phase 0B BDD Integration:**
- **Embed in Service Context**: Mock data becomes part of service documentation
- **BDD Test Scenarios**: Mock data drives Step Functions and Playwright testing
- **Cross-Service Validation**: Mock data enables integration testing across services
- **Schema Validation**: Mock data validates request/response schemas
```

#### **2. MOCK DATA CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS:**

- **üö® CRITICAL**: Same entity IDs (entity_id, resource_id, reference_id) across ALL services
- **Data Flow Integrity**: Mock data flows correctly through service interactions
- **Use Case Completeness**: Mock data supports end-to-end use case testing
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Mock data represents actual system usage patterns
- **Error Coverage**: Mock data includes error conditions and edge cases

#### **3. PHASE 0B INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE:**

- **Service Context Embedding**: Mock data becomes part of service documentation
- **BDD Test Foundation**: Mock data drives all Phase 0B BDD testing
- **Cross-Service Correlation**: Mock responses correlate with other services
- **Validation Foundation**: Mock data enables comprehensive contract validation

This standardized approach ensures every service on the platform follows consistent development practices, maintains quality gates, integrates properly with the broader system architecture, and has a complete mock data foundation for comprehensive testing.

## üîó **IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES**

For concrete implementation examples of these generic patterns, see:
- **`../_impl/`**: Contains system-specific implementations of these patterns
- **`../_impl/ODMD_KK_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**: Complete example of master mock data set generation
- **Service contexts in individual service repositories**: Real-world applications of these patterns

## üöÄ **ULTIMATE PLATFORM BEST PRACTICE**

### **REVOLUTIONARY INSIGHT: PHASES = ENVERS**

The ultimate realization for ONDEMANDENV platform service development:

**Different development phases are actually DIFFERENT ENVERS:**
- **Phase 0** (Contract Verification) = `mock` enver (`workspace1`)
- **Phase 1** (MVP Development) = `dev` enver (`workspace0`)  
- **Phase 2+** (Production) = `main` enver (`workspace0`)

This creates **perfect phase-environment alignment** with appropriate infrastructure, security, and objectives for each stage.

### **ENVER-BASED SERVICE CONTEXT ARCHITECTURE**

For the complete ultimate best practice pattern, see:
**[ENVER_BASED_SERVICE_CONTEXT_PATTERN.md](./ENVER_BASED_SERVICE_CONTEXT_PATTERN.md)**

This pattern provides:
- ‚úÖ **Perfect Phase-Environment Alignment**: Each phase maps to appropriate enver infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Independent Development Streams**: Isolated testing, safe development, production deployment
- ‚úÖ **ONDEMANDENV Platform Optimization**: Leverages platform's native enver-based model
- ‚úÖ **Scalable Architecture**: Consistent pattern across all services

These generic patterns are designed to be adaptable to any system architecture while maintaining consistency and quality across all implementations, with the **ENVER-BASED PATTERN** representing the ultimate evolution of ONDEMANDENV platform service development.

## üîí Cycle Prevention and Location Rules
- OdmdBuild and OdmdEnver definitions MUST live in the organization ContractsLib. Service repositories must not declare builds/envers; they define stacks and runtime/handlers only.
- Do not import service handler Zod or generated consumer types into ContractsLib; validation and codegen happen in service repos and BDD stacks.
- Web client is a consumer of services; services must not depend on `webClientUrl` in app stacks. BDD stacks may reference `webClientUrl` if needed.
- Wiring is centralized in `OndemandContracts.wireBuildCouplings()` after all builds exist; enver constructors create producers and declare consumers, and wiring passes upstream enver instances into `enver.wireCoupling(...)`, where the enver initializes its consumers.
